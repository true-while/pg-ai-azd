### 1. What Resources are getting deployed
This scenario deploys **a basic website index.html file**, displaying Seattle scenery images, coming from 3 different backend services. One is the web app /images folder location, the 2nd one is from within an /images blob container, and the 3rd one is using a Frontdoor with CDN caching towards the web application.  

* MTTDemoDeployRGc%youralias%FDCDN - Azure Resource Group.
* %youralias%fdcdnprofile - Azure FrontDoor with CDN Cache configuration
* %youralias%fdcdnsite - Simple index.html page in Azure App Service
* %youralias%fdserverfarm - Azure App Service Plan
* %youralias%fdstorageaccount - Azure Storage Account, used by Azure Front Door CDN

### What can I demo from this scenario after deployment


### 1. DP-3021. Provision and configure PostgreSQL 

Following demo will intorduces the provisioned services and demonstart how to configure PostgreSQL parameters. 

The following set of paramters could be configured from the page:

**work_mem**: For sorting and hash tables.
maintenance_work_mem: For vacuuming and reindexing.
autovacuum_work_mem: Used by autovacuum processes.
temp_buffers: Stores temporary tables.
effective_cache_size: For OS and DB disk caching.



1. In this scenario, you are streaming images on a webpage, loaded from 3 different storage back-ends. The first scenario involves pulling them in from the App Service local storage folder. 
1. Navigate to the **App Service**, and open the **web app URL** in the browser.
1. Click the **Download from App Service** button.  
1. This shows 6 images, and the load time in millisecs.

<br></br>

1. The 2nd scenario streams images from Azure Storage Account. Open the **%youralias%fdstorageaccount** Azure Storage Account.
1. Navigate to Storage Browser / Blob Containers / **Images** Container and show the 6 image files present.
1. Return to the web page itself, refresh the page in the browser, and click the 2nd button **Download from Azure Blob Storage**
1. Wait for the images to load, and note the loading time. This should be **faster** than the previous scenario.
1. Navigate back to the Azure Portal, and open the **FrontDoor Resource** blade.
1. From the **Overview** blade, explain the **Properties** such as Endpoint hostname, reflecting the name of the FrontDoor Service, the Origin Groups, pointing at the actual service(s) getting published through FrontDoor, and Routes, pointing at how FrontDoor is handling routing traffic.

<br></br>

1.  Select **Origin Groups / default-origin-group** to open its settings. In the Origin Groups blade, select **default-origin-group**.  
1. Explain this is where you configure the backend service getting published by FrontDoor. In our example, the Web App.
1. Click **close** and return to the FrontDoor main blade.
1. Select **Optimizations** from the Settings section. Highlight **Caching** is **Enabled**. 
1. Return to the web page itself, refresh the page in the browser, and click the 3rd button **Download from Azure CDN**
1. Wait for the images to load, which should be the **fastest** of all 3 scenarios.
1. Open a new browser tab, navigate to the web page again, and simulate all 3 download actions. This time, the **Azure CDN** should have an even shorter loading time as before, **confirming it's presented from cache**.

<div style="background: lightblue; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 5px;">

**Tip:** As Azure CDN replicates content across different POPs (Points of Presence), involve your learners into the demo scenario, and ask them to share the loading times of the different scenarios. Especially when you have learners from other regions or geographies, the results are interesting to compare.
